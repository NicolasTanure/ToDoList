📋 ToDoList
A simple project to review and practice my skills with Spring, React, JWT, OAuth2, and Integration!

🚀 Technologies Used

Backend (Spring Boot)

Spring Boot: Framework for creating Java backend applications.
Spring Web: For creating RESTful endpoints.
Spring Data JPA: For data persistence (using an in-memory database).
H2 Database: In-memory database (no external configuration required).
Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors, etc.).
Spring Boot DevTools: For automatic restart during development.
Maven/Gradle: Dependency manager.
Frontend (React)

React: Library for building the user interface.
Axios: For making HTTP calls to the backend API.
React Router: For managing routes in the frontend (optional).
Bootstrap/Material-UI: For quick and responsive styling.
Node.js and npm: To manage dependencies and run the React project.
🛠️ Project Structure

Backend (Spring Boot)

Model: Task class with attributes: id, title, description, completed.
Repository: TaskRepository interface extending JpaRepository for database operations.
Service: TaskService class to implement business logic (create, read, update, delete tasks).
Controller: TaskController class with REST endpoints:
GET /tasks: List all tasks.
POST /tasks: Create a new task.
PUT /tasks/{id}: Update an existing task.
DELETE /tasks/{id}: Delete a task.
CORS Configuration: Allow requests from the frontend (React).
Frontend (React)

Components:
TaskList: To display the list of tasks.
TaskForm: To add or edit a task.
TaskItem: To display the details of an individual task.
API Calls:
Fetch all tasks (GET /tasks).
Create a new task (POST /tasks).
Update a task (PUT /tasks/{id}).
Delete a task (DELETE /tasks/{id}).
Styling: Use Bootstrap or Material-UI to style the components.
🌐 Communication Between Backend and Frontend

JSON: Data format for communication between frontend and backend.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Configuration in the backend to allow frontend requests.
🎯 Features

Task Management: Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use frontend for managing tasks.
In-Memory Database: H2 database for development and testing.
